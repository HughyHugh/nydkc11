6.8.17: postpone video and image support to prioritize completion of the tutorial, and started contact us form to practice forms
continue progress on the blog (MAINLY YOUTUBE)
6.9.17: freeze progress to focus on net database setup
begin artistic drafting of what the pages will look like

6.18.17: finished writing views, research continuing on upload issue, experimented with template extensions
Hit a bit of a problem with inheritance efforts: i was trying to make this code overlap a 'parent class,' but in the main section class, this parent class appears in the section that's supposed to get bundled into a block, which is IN TURN supposed to be re-plugged back into the parent class. Inception. Submitted to Stack Overflow.
6.19.17: bug still not addressed on SO. Surged progress on specific features (e.g. database building). rebuilt "about" app, and dropped "ProjectS" implementation for future. 
6.20.17: original problem for bug was rendered irrevalent. completed contact, forms, and resources page (minus the three critical problems). completed databases for about, but submitted image upload problem to S.O. Began integration of HOME PAGE


6.23.17: kickstarting transition to server

6.27.17: divisional and successfull publish of server

7.1.17: encountered strange Apache test page bug (or close to date). Initially problem expanded to desktop, but now isolated to mobile
things to fix (long term):
 -make app/model for district project. hold off in division until eric publishes the divisional project (DELAY all projects until Eric publishes divisional project)
 -onging 403 forbidden bug (POSSIBLE fix, wait until need to upload new sets of images)
 -add image gallery section (VETOED)
  
things to fix:
  - hear suggestions from board!
start doing research on the following:
	-cross google drive implemetnation (for divisonal photos) (LOW PRIORITY GOAL FOR NOW!)
	-facebook automation (VETOED)
	-mobile app????
